Whisper is a distributed chat system with one-to-one secure connection between three different clients (Android, iOS and Web) that use Firebase as a back-end with a Real Time NoSQL JSON database, which is specifically designed to transmit rapid information between the server and the clients.

Our main challenge was to develop a software that works properly, while dealing with a group composed of professionals from different backgrounds, other than software engineering. For us, this represented multiple challenges, ranging from learning new tools like \LaTeX{} and GitHub (and its methodology to collaborate as a group), to learning coding across different languages that some of us didn't even know.
